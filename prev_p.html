            <h2><i class="fas fa-bug"></i>   About Ticks</h2>
            <p>Preventing tick bites and protecting yourself from tick-borne infections and diseases involves several protective measures. Firstly, when spending time in wooded or grassy areas, wear long sleeves and long pants to minimize exposed skin. Apply insect repellent  to both skin and clothing. Conduct thorough tick checks on yourself after being outdoors, focusing on areas such as armpits, behind the knees and ears, in the hair and around the waistband.</p> 
            <p>Immediately showering after outdoor activities can help remove unattached ticks. Keep your yard tick-free by mowing the lawn regularly. Use tick control treatments on pets to prevent them from bringing ticks indoors. If you find a tick attached to your skin, use fine-tipped tweezers to grasp it as close to the skin's surface as possible and pull upward with steady, even pressure, or head to a clinic or hospital for a doctor to remove it.</p>
            <p>Clean the bite area and your hands with rubbing alcohol, soap and water. Watch for signs of tick-borne illnesses, such as rash or fever, and seek medical attention if symptoms develop. Keeping these practices in mind will significantly reduce the risk of tick bites and the associated infections and diseases.</p>
