                    <div class="text2">"It's crucial to perform regular tick checks after spending time outdoors, especially in wooded or grassy areas. Ticks can transmit diseases like Lyme disease, babesiosis, and anaplasmosis, so finding and removing ticks promptly can significantly reduce the risk of disease transmission. Pay particular attention to hidden areas such as the scalp, armpits, and groin. Use a mirror or ask for help to check hard-to-see areas. Early detection and removal are key to preventing tick-borne illnesses."</div>

                    <div class="text2">"Preventing tick bites is the first line of defense against tick-borne diseases. Wear long sleeves and long pants tucked into socks when hiking or spending time in areas where ticks are common. Using tick repellents that contain DEET or permethrin on clothing and gear can further reduce the risk. After returning indoors, putting clothes in a hot dryer for 10 minutes can kill any ticks that might be on them. If you do find a tick attached, remove it immediately and monitor the bite site for any signs of rash or infection."</div>

                    <div class="text2">"Showering within two hours of coming indoors can help wash off unattached ticks and is an excellent opportunity to do a thorough tick check. Ticks often climb upwards, so pay attention to your lower legs and work your way up. Parents should check their children thoroughly, especially on the scalp and behind the ears. If you have pets, regularly check them for ticks as well, since they can bring ticks into your home."</div>

                    <div class="text2">"Pets can be a source of ticks in your household, so using tick prevention products recommended by your veterinarian is essential. These products can include topical treatments, collars, or oral medications that repel and kill ticks. Regular grooming and checking your pets for ticks, especially after they have been outdoors, can help catch ticks early before they attach to your pets or fall off and pose a risk to humans."</div>

                    <div class="text2">"Using tick repellents that contain ingredients like picaridin or oil of lemon eucalyptus can be highly effective in preventing tick bites. It's important to apply these repellents not only on exposed skin but also on clothing and gear. Always follow the product instructions carefully. When spending time in tick-prone areas, wear light-colored clothing, which makes it easier to spot ticks, and do frequent tick checks."</div>

                    <div class="text2">"Creating a tick-safe zone in your yard can significantly reduce the number of ticks. Keep your lawn mowed, remove leaf litter and brush, and place wood chips or gravel between lawns and wooded areas to create a barrier. These measures can help create an environment that is less conducive to ticks. Additionally, using tick tubes—card2board tubes filled with treated cotton that mice use for nesting—can help reduce the number of ticks by targeting their hosts. Taking these steps can protect your family and pets from tick bites around your home."</div>
