            <h2><i class="fas fa-bug"></i>   About Ticks</h2>
            <p>Ticks carry a variety of different diseases, but considerably the deadliest one is the Lyme disease. It has first been documented in 1975 in a small town near Connecticut, called Old Lyme. Two years later, it was discovered that the Lyme disease is carried by ticks and is a very deadly disease that can lead to a fatal end. The told-to-be version of the Lyme disease's origin story is the following:</p> 
            <p>In the early 1970s, USA military scientists developed the Lyme disease as a weapon of mass execution that is spread by infected ticks. The military weapon experiment failed and all the bacteria that caused the Lyme disease were killed. Although the bacteria were "taken care of", the ticks somehow spread outside the military lab and out in the open.</p>
            <p>Lyme disease can produce a wide range of symptoms. The period between the tick bite and the first symptom is usually about 1-2 weeks. Roughly 80% of Lyme infections begin with a rash of some sort at the site of a tick bite, often near skin folds such as the armpits, back of the knee, or the torso under clothing straps, or in children's hair, ears, or neck. In the early stages of infection, the infected spot are in a "bull's eye" appearance with no other symptoms. In the second phase of infection, about 2 weeks later, symptoms like dizziness, ear ringing, headaches, swelling, muscle soreness, and trouble sleeping. The third phase, appearing months or even years after the tick bite, symptoms like weak coordination, dementia, not being able to feel your limbs, sometimes even insanity and death. </p>
